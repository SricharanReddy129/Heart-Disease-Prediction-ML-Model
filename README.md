# Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML-Model
**Problem Definition:** To predict if a given person is prone to heart disease or not based on the given data - Age, Sex, Diet, Exercise, ChestPain, etc.

- This is a simple machine-learning model that predicts heart disease.
- The model is built based on Supervised Learning.
- The project consists of various steps:
- 1. Data preprocessing
  2. Feature Engineering
  3. Model fitting, by experimenting with various models
  4. Hyperparameter tuning
  5. Evaluation

- I have updated the project into an webapplication, using Django framrwork.
- 1. I have dveloped a single page dynamic webpage using HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap.
  2. Then integrated the frontend and predictor (previously developed ML model) using Django features.
  3. To integrate the Ml model, instead of connecting to entire Python code, I have saved my best model using Jobli as '.pkl' file.
  4. I have then imported the saved model into the Django framework.
