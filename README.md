# Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML-Model
**Problem Definition:** To predict if a given person is prone to heart disease or not based on the given data - Age, Sex, Diet, Exercise, ChestPain, etc.

- This is a simple machine-learning model that predicts heart disease.
- The model is built based on Supervised Learning.
- The project consists of various steps:
- 1. Data preprocessing
  2. Feature Engineering
  3. Model fitting, by experimenting with various models
  4. Hyperparameter tuning
  5. Evaluation
